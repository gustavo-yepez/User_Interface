<h1>Art Portfolio</h1>


As an artist I want to be able to show off my work. I'm a photographer and I have a lot of amazing foodie pics I'd like to share with potential clients, but I need a site that is more professional than Instagram in order to do so.

MVP: User can visit site and see artists photos laid out in a grid , artist can create, read update photos. No ability to upload one's own photos.
MVP Features Breakdown:

This app contains two user types. An artist (who has the ability to log in) and a single user (no need to log in so no need for user data to be persisted on this user type) who can view an artist's portfolio.

Stretch Goal: Build an image uploader into the site to allow users the ability to upload their own assets. (This will require some work with a package called Drop Zone and a service called cloudinary).
